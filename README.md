## How to Use (Web UI - Recommended)

### Step 1: Download Your Instagram Data

First, you need to request your "Followers and following" data from Instagram.

1.  On the Instagram app or website, go to your profile.
2.  Navigate to **Menu** > **Your activity**.
3.  Select **Download your information** > **Download or transfer information**.
4.  Choose **Some of your information**.
5.  Select only **"Followers and following"** and tap **Next**.
6.  Choose **Download to device** and tap **Next**.
7.  Set the format to **JSON** and the date range to **All time**. Tap **Save**.

Instagram will notify you when your `.zip` file is ready to download.

### Step 2: Use the Web Tool

1.  Go to the live tool: [**https://damiad.github.io/instagram-no-follow-back/**](https://damiad.github.io/instagram-no-follow-back/)
2.  Upload your data using one of the two options:
    -   **Option A (Recommended):** Upload the entire `.zip` file you downloaded from Instagram.
    -   **Option B:** If you unzipped the file, upload the parent directory (e.g., `connections`).
3.  Adjust the "Skip Oldest" and "Max Tabs" parameters if needed.
4.  Click the **Find Non-Followers** button.

### Step 3: Review the Results

The tool will display a sorted list of users who don't follow you back.

> **IMPORTANT: Enable Pop-ups!**
> When you click the **"Open Profiles in New Tabs"** button, your browser will likely block the pop-ups initially. **Look for a pop-up blocked icon** in your browser's address bar. Click it and choose **"Always allow pop-ups and redirects from..."** for the site to work correctly.

## Alternative Method (Python Script)

For users who prefer a command-line interface, the original Python script is still available in the repository.

### Instructions

1.  Download your Instagram data as described in Step 1 above and unzip it.
2.  Place the `followers_and_following` directory inside the project folder.
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 non-follow-back-detector.py
    ```
